This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
This program is intended to show the Tidy dataset. 

Part1: Loading and Preprocessing the Data
The program downloads the file from the file location. 
sets working directory of the Project
Download the Dataset from the url location
unzip the file to the data location. Reads all th files to respective variables of the dataframes.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(Hmisc)
# Set the working directory for the Project
setwd ("C://DataSceince//Reproduceable_research//Reproduceable-Research-CourseProject1")
#Download the file from the file location
if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/activity.zip")
#unZip the file for data
unzip(zipfile="./data/activity.zip",exdir="./data")


activity<- read.csv(".//data//activity.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")
head(activity)
trimActivity<- na.omit(activity)
```


Part2: Process the mean total number of steps taken per day
    Calculate the total number of Steps Taken per day.Plot in a historgram

```{r}
TotalSteps <- aggregate(activity$steps~activity$date, activity,sum)
hist(TotalSteps$`activity$steps`,breaks= 25, ylab = "Frequency using Count", xlab = "TotalSteps")
meanSteps<- mean(TotalSteps$`activity$steps`)
medianSteps<- median(TotalSteps$`activity$steps`)

```
The Mean Steps per day `r meanSteps`
The Median Steps per day `r medianSteps`

Daily Activity Pattern based on interval. Plot the Daily activity pattern
Find the interval which has the maximum steps 
```{r}
Dailyaverage <- aggregate(activity$steps~activity$interval,activity,FUN=mean)
ggplot(Dailyaverage, aes(Dailyaverage$`activity$interval`, Dailyaverage$`activity$steps`)) +geom_line() + ylab("Daily Views")
maxsteps<- which.max(Dailyaverage[,2])
maxinterval<-Dailyaverage[maxsteps[1],1]

```
The Maximum steps attained interval `r maxinterval`

Calculate the maximum number of NA
```{r}
TotalNA <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```
Total Missing Values `r TotalNA`

Missing values to be filled with mean of the day
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r}
Stactivity <- activity
Stactivity$steps <- impute(activity$steps,mean)
TotalStepsst <- aggregate(Stactivity$steps~Stactivity$date, Stactivity,sum)
hist(TotalStepsst$`Stactivity$steps`,breaks= 25, ylab = "Frequency using Count", xlab = "TotalSteps")
Stmeansteps <- mean(TotalStepsst$`Stactivity$steps`)
Stmediansteps <- median(TotalStepsst$`Stactivity$steps`)

```
The Mean Steps per day `r Stmeansteps`
The Median Steps per day `r Stmediansteps`
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
```{r}

```
